## Motivations

A key bottleneck to the creation and increased prevalence of alternative societal structures is the failure of the interests, resources, and skills of those people to be matched to the communities most suited for them.

## How to run

## what society-matcher does

To address this need, society-matcher allows users to indicate their interests in features communities and what they have to offer, such as specific skills, financial resources or land and infrastructure available to be used to develop these communities.

## How to use as a person interested in joining a community
Fill out the set of interests you have. The features of a community which match your desires will be automatically determined. A rating system for your interests will be applied to existing communities. 

## How to use as a community looking for people
Fill out the set of needs you have and users who match your needs and are interested in communities similar to yours will be identified for your. 

## What if a community doesn't match my needs?
If there is not a strong match for existing communities, this is indicated from the results of the identifier. Once a large enough group of people are identified which don't have a community matching their interests, they are notified and put into contact with each other.
